# Description
This document is a holding place for ideas related to this project. 
It is a markdown file and as such allows for some formatting, but should also be quick and easy to edit when ideas strike.

# Model ideas
## wake combination
Wakes are typically combined using the square of the L2 norm. However, in a distribution perhaps we could use the ideas in 
Strang V.5 equation 10 for the weighted least squares.
